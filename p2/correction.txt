PART-3

In order to prevent data loss after delay operation, you can add zeros at the beginning and end of the 
input array as many as the number of maximum delay amount. 
For example when x = [1,2,3,4] and the delay amount is in the interval of [-3,3], 
you can apply zero padding to input x as x = [0,0,0,1,2,3,4,0,0,0]. After this operation you can 
apply time delay in the given interval without any information loss.
e.g. [0,0,0,1,2,3,4,0,0,0] -> delayed by 3 -> [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4]

After zero padding, you can implement delay function by using the pseudocode given below or you can 
use your own method.
if(delay>0):
x_delayed = zeros(1,length(x))
x_delayed(delay+1:length(x)) = x(1:length(x)-delay)
else:
x_delayed = zeros(1,length(x))
x_delayed(1:length(x)+ delay) = x(-delay+1:length(x))


PART-4
You can use x1 =[-3 -4 2 0 1 4 3 6 3 7] as the input for this part. You should test the 
system for all the values of n from 1 to N. (N is the greatest index number of the input)
